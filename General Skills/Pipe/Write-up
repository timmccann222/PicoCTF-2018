In this challenge I am given an address to netcat to. The title and hint for the challenge suggest I use piping which
I discussed and have used in some of the previous write-ups ( see: GREP 1).

I type the command to netcat to the address as we would normally and then pipe the output from that command to my grep
command as shown:

 $nc 2018shell3.picoctf.com 37542 | grep pico

The flag i got was: picoCTF{almost_like_mario_a6975cdb}
