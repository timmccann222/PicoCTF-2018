I am given a file and asked to search for the flag in it. The challenge tells me that searching through the file would
take too long and so advises me to find another way to search for the flag. The hint and title of the challenge both
suggest that i use grep. grep is a command in linux that searches for patterns in text files that we want to find.

I first navigate to the correct directory from are shell:

 $cd /problems/grep-1_4_0431431e36a950543a85426d0299343e

Next, I use ls and find a ASCII text file. I use cat on the file and I am given a large output:

 $cat file

Rather than sift through the output from the file and find the flag, I instead use the grep command and a pipe. Piping
is a way of redirecting output from a file or program in linux and is represented with a | . Here I am redirecting the
output I get from using cat on the file to my grep command which will search for the pattern I specified, which in this
case will be 'pico':

 $cat file | grep pico

This returns the flag: picoCTF{grep_and_you_will_find_d66382d8}
