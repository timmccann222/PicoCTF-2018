I am given an address to netcat to. Once I get in I am given a series of instructions which require knowledge of basic
linux commands. I will just go over the actual answer and not spend to much time on exploring or the process of
searching, that is something you can do for practice if you wish :)

I first cd into the secret directory:

 $cd secret

Next I use ls to see what is in the directory:

 $ls

Now i us the rm command which removes the intel_1 file as asked:

 $rm intel_1

I then have to type echo 'Drop it in!':

 $echo 'Drop it in!'

Next I go to the executables folder where there should be an executable file there for me:

 $cd ..
 $cd executables
 $./dontLookHere

Now I am asked to print the name of the user to the string which can be done with the whoami command:

 $whoami

I am then asked to copy a file called TopSecret from the tmp directory to the passwords directory, this must be done
from the home directory which is denoted by the ~/ :

 $ cp /tmp/TopSecret passwords/

Finally, I must go to the passwords directory and read the file:

 $cat TopSecret

This is the flag: picoCTF{CrUsHeD_It_17ab99f5}
