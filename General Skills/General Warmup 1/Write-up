I am asked to convert 0x41 from hexadecimal to ASCII.

I used an online converter for this challenge, just enter 0x41 then hit convert:

I also used an ASCII table to confirm my answer, just look through the table for the hex value 0x41 then look at the
equivalent ASCII character:

Both methods gave me the flag: picoCTF{A}
