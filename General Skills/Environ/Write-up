In this challenge I am asked to find a flag hidden in a environment variable. An environment variable is a dynamic-named
value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. They are part of the environment in which a
process runs.

To view environment variables on linux is use the following command:

 $printenv

I scroll to the top and find the flag: picoCTF{eNv1r0nM3nT_v4r14Bl3_fL4g_3758492}
