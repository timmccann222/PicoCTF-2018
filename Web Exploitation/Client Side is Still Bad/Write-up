I am given a link which takes me to a page with a login. I first inspect the source code and see that the flag is split
into 4 in the source code in the javascript function called verify.

Once I reconstruct the flag, I can enter it in the login to verify I got the flag. A alert will popup telling you that
you got the flag.

The flag is : picoCTF{client_is_bad_9117e9}
