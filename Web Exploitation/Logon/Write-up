I am given a link in this challenge which takes me to a login page. The hint tells us that the login only checks for
when the admin log's in.

For this challenge I used a tool called BurpSuite which is a graphical tool for testing Web application security. It can
It operates as a web proxy server between your browser and target applications, and lets you intercept, inspect and
modify the raw traffic passing in both directions. It essentially acts like a middle man, capturing messages and looking
at them before sending them on to their receiver. It can be downloaded for windows or it is already available in Kali if
you have Kali Linux operating system installed.

I setup burpsuite with are chosen browser, in my case firefox and make sure the intercept button is on. I then click
sigin and capture the packet, I forward it on and then a second packet comes up which has a cookie parameter called
admin and set to false. I change this to admin=true and click forward. This gets our flag.

This is the flag: picoCTF{l0g1ns_ar3nt_r34l_92020990}
