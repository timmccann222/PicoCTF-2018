In this challenge I am given some encrypted text and asked to decipher it. The title of the challenge indicates it is
a Vignère cipher as it was invented by Blaise de Vigenère. The cipher works by shifting each individual letter a number
of places based on the letters of a keyword. It is a form of polyalphabetic substitution. In order to decrypt the text
we need akey which we do not have. All we have is the cipher text.

In a normal situation it would be very difficult to decipher the hidden text without the key but in this challenge
we can actually find the key by using the cipher text and what we know about what will be in the plaintext. I use the
online tool below to help with this:

First enter your encrypted text, then type two letters ab where the key is. We know that each flag starts with picoCTF
so we can find the what the first letter in the key is by typing in b,c,d,e etc until the first letter of the plaintext
starts with a p. We repeat the process for the second letter in the key until the second letter in the plaintext changes
to i. You see how this works. We eventually get the key which decrypts the cipher text giving us the flag. This only
works because we know what the start of the plaintext is, which allows us to map out the key.

Another way to decrypt the key is t use the following table:

We can map the letters of the encrypted text to the plaintext since we know what the start of the flag is.

The flag for me is: picoCTF{substitution_ciphers_are_too_easy_nlrgrwmynn}
