We are given a message from a friend, llkjmlmpadkkc with the key of thisisalilkey.

I use an online tool to solve this rather than by hand:

 https://geocaching.dennistreysa.de/multisolver/index.html


This tool confirms that it is a Vignère cipher. It can also be considered a Larrabee cipher which is similar to the
Vignère cipher but with the main difference that also numbers can be encoded. Since there are no numbers in this
ciphertext a decoder for either will work.

I obtained the following flag: picoCTF{secretmessage}
