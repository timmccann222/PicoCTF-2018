In this problem I am given cvpbPGS{guvf_vf_pelcgb!} and asked if I ever heard of ROT13. ROT13 is a simple letter
substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of
the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome.

I used an online tool for this:

This gave me the flag: picoCTF{this_is_crypto!}
