I am given a data.pcap file which holds captured network traffic. I use a tool called wireshark to open this pcap file.
I am then presented with a number of TCP and HTTP packets. I right click on the first packet and then select follow TCP
stream. This then presents me with html code. In the bottom right hand corner it says stream with two arrows beside it.
Hit the up arrow and examine each new page carefully. I eventually come across the flag in the code.

This is the flag: picoCTF{n0ts3cur3_9feedfbc}
