We are given a file and asked to unzip it.

I use the file command on linux to make sure it is a zip file:

 $file flag.zip

Next I use the unzip command to unzip the file:

 $unzip flag.zip

Once unzipped, I am given a JPEG file. I use the eog command to view the image:

 $eog flag.jpg

This gives me the flag: picoCTF{welcome_to_forensics}
