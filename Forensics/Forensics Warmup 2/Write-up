I am given a PNG image that has an error when I try to open it.

I use the file command to check the image:

 $file flag.png

I see from the above output that it is actually a JPEG file but has been given a .png extension.

To fix this I copy the flag.png file to a new flag.jpeg file:

 $cp flag.png flag.jpg

Now that the image has the correct file extension I can open it using the eog command:

 $eog flag.jpg

This gives me the flag: picoCTF{extensions_are_a_lie}
