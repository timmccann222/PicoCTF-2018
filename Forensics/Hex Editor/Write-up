In this challenge I am given a image and asked to examine it's hex code. I use a tool in kali called hexeditor:

 $hexeditor example.jpg

I use ctrl+w to search for strings in the file by using pico as the search string. I find the flag at the very end of
the image.

The flag is: picoCTF{and_thats_how_u_edit_hex_kittos_3E03e57d}
