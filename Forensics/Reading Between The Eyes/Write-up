I am given an image of a husky and have to find the flag. The hint suggests to use an online decoder but I instead used
a tool called zsteg. This a useful tool which can be installed on kali linux and used to detect stegano-hidden data in
PNG & BMP

 $zsteg husky.eog

This is the flag: picoCTF{r34d1ng_b37w33n_7h3_by73s}
