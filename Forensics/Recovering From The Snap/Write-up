I am given a animals.dd file and asked to find the flag. For this challenge i used the tool FTK Imager from Access Data
which is a data preview and imaging tool used to acquire data (evidence) in a forensically sound manner by creating
copies of data without making changes to the original evidence.

I add the animals.dd file to the tool as evidence and find a number of images which includes an image called the flag.

The flag is: picoCTF{th3_5n4p_happ3n3d}
