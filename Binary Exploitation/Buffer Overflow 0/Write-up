I am given a program and asked to overflow the buffer. I need to be on the websites server to do this as that is where
the flag.txt file is. After examining the code I see a function called vuln that has a char buffer which is 16 bytes in
size. If I overwrite this by passing in a large enough argument I will get a buffer overflow which will cause a
segmentation fault, giving us the flag.

 $./vuln aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

This gives me the flag: picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_2d11f6cd}
